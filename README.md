### **Problem Statement: AI for intelligent camera decision making ⏳**

Design and implement an AI-based intelligent camera decision-making system that can process video data, identify important events, and automatically make informed decisions in real-time. This automated system will also automatically warn the police sentry at the police station as well as the district police control room when some suspicious activity is observed by the camera.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Solution Description: 💡**

Our AI-powered CCTV Analysis system detects and respond to suspicious behavior. Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), we capture and store best-possible-quality videos or images of individuals involved in the incidents. Our ML Model, integrating YOLOv3, identifies weapons and unusual objects, alerting officers in real-time. Intelligent Suspicious Activity Detection is achieved through a custom-trained Neural network with feedback-based learning, utilizing openly available CCTV incident video footage. The system also features Risky Movement Detection using an optimized RRN and mmpose or Mediapipe Pose estimation, decoding body language and identifying potential security threats. An adaptive learning loop allows police verification and feedback, enhancing system accuracy. Quick-action alerts promptly notify the police, providing precise information and capturing incident images. Sound-based triggers aid in instant officer response, and AES encryption ensures the security of CCTV recordings. The user-friendly dashboard, with built-in access management, categorizes materials for quick retrieval. The cost-effective system optimizes cloud storage usage for real-time CCTV footage analysis.

### **Development Stages 🚀**

**📅 Dec 14, 2023:** The results were declared and we got mail at 11:00PM

**👩‍💻 Dec 15, 2023:** Got down to business by splitting tasks among the team. 
  1. Vishal is building the dashboard and other backend stuffs and also helping with the ML stuff,
  2. Shrreya is figuring out who's who with face detection & recognition,
  3. Christina is on the lookout for risky movements, and
  4. Yogeeshwaran is tackling weapons detection and backing up the other ML folks.

**🏡 Dec 16, 2023:** Hit a cool milestone with our Home page, showing off CCTV feeds and recorded stuff using Next.js.

**🐍 Dec 17, 2023:** Wrapped up the behind-the-scenes stuff with Python and Flask, so now our system records scenes when it spots someone's face or body.

**🕺 Dec 18, 2023:** Got the pose estimation thing working with Media Pipe, calculating angles and positions!

**🧠 Dec 19, 2023:** Started grabbing data for recognizing weapons and faces. Also, made sure our CCTV recording smoothly fits into the Front-End, making things look good and work great.💪✨
